# Education Inequality
This project's goal is to determine if socioeconomic factors potentially have a bearing on school performance.

# Data
School ACT and SAT data was collected from Edgap.org. Some information from schools was also gathered from the National Center for Education Statistics.

A more accessable version of the NCES data can be accessed here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/lkl5nvcdmwyoban/ccd_sch_029_1617_w_1a_11212017.csv?dl=0

## Data Preparation
The taken data was joined together, and unreasonable and irrelevant data were taken out. The data was also split into training and testing sets.

The file data_prep/Education_Inequality_Data_Preparation.ipynb was used to complete the Data Preparation. The training data is under data_prep/educ_ineq_training.csv and the testing data is under educ_ineq_testing.csv.
